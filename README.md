At the end of this course the student will be able to understand the characteristics of a stochastic process. It knows different types of queue models and the performance of various level protocols of data link layer. Will be able to set parameters of the system and performance parameters to study the behavior of computer systems and networks of Telecommunication using simulations.

This repository is for the Quantitative Methods and Simulation course: Homeworks, Activities and more.
